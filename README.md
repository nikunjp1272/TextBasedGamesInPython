# TextBasedGamesInPython
Some text based games you can learn from as a beginner. Most of which will only need some expertise in Python. There will be instructions for some of the games for editing. But feel free to change it up.

CompNumGuesser - Let the computer guess the number that you're thinking of in a limit of digits. You can change the limit to make it more interesting.

GuessAlphabetNum - Let the computer decide an alphabet which you need to guess to win the game.

RPSLC - Sheldon Cooper the ultimate nerd invented the game in Big Bang theory which then became quite fun to try out with Python.

RandomStoryGenerator - The idea is to let all the work be done by the random library as most games do. Just using some very basic data structures for the purpose.
